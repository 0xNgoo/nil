# `Nil.js` deploying a smart contract

## Overview

This tutorial deploys two smart contracts:

* [**`Retailer.sol`**](https://github.com/NilFoundation/nil/blob/main/docs/tests/Retailer.sol): this contract can call a special 'manufacturer' contract and order new products by performing an async call.
* [**`Manufacturer.sol`**](https://github.com/NilFoundation/nil/blob/main/docs/tests/Manufacturer.sol): this contract can accept orders from the retailer and fulfil them by 'manufacturing' and sending new products.

## Internal deployment

:::tip

When submitting contract bytecode as a string to a deployment transaction, preface it with "0x".

The contract ABI can be copy-pasted from the `./abi` file and then cast into the `Abi` type.

To deploy the retailer contract:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-niljs.test.mjs start=startInternalDeployOfRetailer end=endInternalDeployOfRetailer
```

To deploy the manufacturer contract:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-niljs.test.mjs start=startInternalDeployOfManufacturer end=endInternalDeployOfManufacturer
```
