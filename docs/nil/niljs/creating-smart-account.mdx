# `Nil.js`: creating a smart account

`Nil.js` library exposes the `SmartAccountV1` class that allows for quickly creating and deploying a new smart account:

```typescript showLineNumbers file=../../tests/creating-a-smart-account.test.mjs start=startNilJSSmartAccountImports end=endNilJSSmartAccountImports
```

```typescript showLineNumbers file=../../tests/creating-a-smart-account.test.mjs start=startNilJSSmartAccountCreation end=endNilJSSmartAccountCreation
```

This example initializes a new smart account, provides it with a `Signer` and requests a top up to the smart account address. The smart account is then deployed.

:::tip[Seqno]

When using the client library, `seqno` defaults to `0` for every transaction sent via the smart account. If too many transactions are sent at the same time with this `seqno`, they will fail. To avoid this issue, set the `seqno` manually whenever using the smart account:

```ts showLineNumbers
smartAccount.sendTransaction({
    ...
    seqno: SEQNO,
    ...
})
```
