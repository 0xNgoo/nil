# Block explorer

The =nil; block explorer is a GUI for reading information from the cluster such as block statistics and transaction data.

[**Access the =nil; block explorer**](https://explore.nil.foundation/).

## Home screen

The home screen of the =nil; block explorer includes the following components.

### Search 

<img src={SearchBar} className='roundedImage' />

The search bar allows for retrieving blocks, transactions or accounts by hash, shard ID, and block height.


### Transactions counter

<img src={TransactionsCounter} className='roundedImage'/>

The transactions counter shows the total number of transactions recorded during a particular time period. It also contains a bar chart showing how many transactions were recorded during the selected time interval.

### Latest blocks

The latest blocks table shows information about newly generated blocks including their height, shard ID, date, and transaction count.

The account screen contains the details of a particular smart contract.

It provides the following information:

| Field | Definition |
|:--:|:--|
| Address | The address of the smart contract. |
| Balance | The balance of the smart contract. |
| Tokens | The custom tokens possessed by the smart contract. |
| Code | The contract bytecode. |

| Field | Definition |
|:--:|:--|
| Shard ID | The ID of the shard where the block was generated. |
| Height | The block height. |
| Incoming transactions | The incoming transactions included in the block. |
| Outgoing transactions | The outgoing transactions included in the block. |
| Time | The time when the block was generated. |

The '**Incoming transactions**' and '**Outgoing transactions**' tabs contain tables listing all incoming and outgoing transactions included in the block.
