# Release 15.10.2024: migration guide

This release of =nil; adds support of the `onlyResponse` modifier, changes token IDs to be of the `address` type and launches the token faucet service.

## Summary of key changes

* The newly added token faucet service makes it easy to transfer the default token (NIL) as well as various pre-set tokens (e.g., 'mock' implementations BTC or USDT) to any address
* The `onlyResponse` modifier limits access to callback functions used in `sendRequest()`, making sure they can only be called by the response to a given request
* `TokenId` is a new alias for the `address` type, fully replacing the previous token IDs which were of the `uin256` type

## Migration of smart contracts

* Replace usage of `uint256` in token IDs with `TokenId`

`TokenId` is an alias for the `address` type which fully replaces the previous system where token IDs were of the `uint256` type. To cast a contract address to a `TokenId`:

```solidity showLineNumbers
TokenId id = TokenId.wrap(address(this));
```

This change simplifies the management of custom tokens as there is no longer a need to keep track of separate token addresses and their IDs.

* Mark callback functions with the `onlyResponse` modifier

The `Nil.sol` library now includes the `onlyResponse` modifier. After this modifier is applied to a function, said function can only be called by responses that arrive to the requests sent via `sendRequest()`. The modifier protects callback functions from being unfairly executed by malicious parties.

## Migration of the =nil; CLI

No specific changes have to be made to the =nil; CLI commands.

## Migration of Nil.js scripts

The Nil.js client library now supports several useful 'wrappers' designed to simplify work with the faucet service.
