# Hardhat plugin usage

=nil; provides an example repository containing a Hardhat project that is already configured to support all essential cluster features.

To install the project generator:

```bash
npm i @nilfoundation/create-nil-hardhat-project -g
```

Create a new project:

```bash
create-nil-hardhat-template
```

When inside the project, create an `.env` file and add the following information inside it:

```
NIL_RPC_ENDPOINT=NIL_ENDPOINT
SMART_ACCOUNT_ADDR=SMART_ACCOUNT_ADDR
PRIVATE_KEY=PRIVATE_KEY
COMETA_ENDPOINT=COMETA_ENDPOINT
```

:::tip

[**Read this tutorial**](getting-started/nil-101.mdx) to learn how to create a smart account.

:::

If possible, link the `.env` file to the config file for the =nil; CLI:

```
NIL_CONFIG_INI: path/to/config.ini
```

In this case, the Hardhat plugin will automatically use the smart account and private key specified in the CLI config file. Whenever the CLI creates a new smart account. the Hardhat plugin will start using said smart account.

It is also possible to create a new smart account directly via the Hardhat plugin by running this task:

```bash
smart-account update
```

To see the smart account details:

```bash
smart-account info
```

:::info[Fee credit]

The Hardhat plugin has a hardcoded default fee credit that should be enough for most transactions. To override this value, specify the `feeCredit` property in `hardhat.config.ts`:

```ts showLineNumbers
feeCredit: 500000
```
