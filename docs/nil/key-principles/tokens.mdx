# Tokens support

## Definition

=nil; supplies a basic 'default' token (NIL).

The network also has a multi-token mechanism. All accounts (smart contracts) can be paid in any number of arbitrary tokens created either by the account owner or other accounts.

:::info

While custom tokens can be transferred between accounts, they cannot be used for paying for essential functionalities of =nil; such as deploying contracts or sending async calls.

:::

:::info

A contract can only be the owner of one token. While non-owners can transfer different tokens between accounts, they cannot mint any tokens that they do not own.

## Token faucet service

The token faucet is a special service whose main purpose is to distribute default cluster tokens (NIL) that are used to pay for contract deployment and transaction execution. In addition, the faucet also distributes various pre-set 'mock' tokens such as USDC and BTC.

Each token faucet resides at a different address. To withdraw a specific token, simply call the corresponding address using the `faucet_TopUpViaFaucet` method.

### Usage

#### Via the =nil; testnet

The faucet service resides at the `http://api.devnet.nil.foundation/api/faucet/${USERNAME}/${TOKEN}` endpoint.

To see all active faucets:

```bash
curl -X POST http://api.devnet.nil.foundation/api/faucet/${USERNAME}/${TOKEN} \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 0, "method": "faucet_getFaucets", "params": []}'
```

Expected response:

```bash
{
  "jsonrpc":"2.0",
  "id":0,
  "result":
  {
    "BTC":"0x0001111111111111111111111111111111111114",
    "ETH":"0x0001111111111111111111111111111111111112",
    "NIL":"0x0001111111111111111111111111111111111110",
    "USDT":"0x0001111111111111111111111111111111111113"
  }
}
```

To withdraw from a faucet:

```bash
curl -X POST http://api.devnet.nil.foundation/api/${USERNAME}/${TOKEN} \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 0, "method": "faucet_topUpViaFaucet", "params": ["$FAUCET_ADDRESS", "$SMART_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS", $AMOUNT]}'
```

Expected output:

```bash
{
  "jsonrpc":"2.0",
  "id":0,
  "result": HASH
}
```

#### Via running the faucet locally

It is also possible to run the faucet service locally. 

First, enter the Nix development environment:

```bash
nix develop
```

Then, build the faucet binary:

```bash
make faucet
```

Launch the faucet binary at port `8527`:

```bash
./build/bin/faucet run
```

It should now be possible to send requests to the faucet service at `http://127.0.0.1:8527`.
