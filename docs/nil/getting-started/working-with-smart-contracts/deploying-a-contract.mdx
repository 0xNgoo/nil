# Deploying a contract

This guide lists all possible methods for deploying the [**tutorial contracts**](writing-a-contract.mdx).

## Prerequisites

Complete the following tutorials before proceeding.

* [**Writing a contract**](writing-a-contract.mdx)

## Internal deployment

An internal deployment of a contract is made by another smart contract (as all smart accounts are smart contracts, this also applies to smart accounts).

Internal transactions pay for themselves by spending their `value`. As a result, there is no need to send funds to a particular address before deploying a contract there. This allows for handling deployment in just one transaction.

:::info

The contract constructor has to be set as `payable` to support internal deployment via some developer tools (such as the =nil; CLI),

:::

### Via the =nil; CLI

To deploy Contract 1 via the =nil; CLI:

```bash file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-cli.test.mjs start=startRetailerDeploymentCommand end=endRetailerDeploymentCommand
```

Take note of the address for Contract 1. To retrieve the smart account public key:

```bash file=../../../tests/commands.mjs start=startInfo end=endInfo
```

To deploy Contract 2 with the given public key and the address of the retailer contract:

```bash file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-cli.test.mjs start=startManufacturerDeploymentCommand end=endManufacturerDeploymentCommand
```

This will make sure that `Manufacturer` and `Retailer` are on different shards.

### Via the client library

:::tip

When submitting contract bytecode as a string to a deployment transaction, preface it with "0x".

The contract ABI can be copy-pasted from the `./abi` file and then cast into the `Abi` type.

:::

To deploy the retailer contract:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-niljs.test.mjs start=startInternalDeployOfRetailer end=endInternalDeployOfRetailer
```

To deploy the manufacturer contract:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-niljs.test.mjs start=startInternalDeployOfManufacturer end=endInternalDeployOfManufacturer
```

## External deployment

An external deployment of a contract is made by a user or another entity outside of the cluster.

As is the case with all external transactions, an external deployment must be paid by the contract at the address to which the call is maid. However, before deployment, this address is unoccupied. To proceed with external deployment, an entity must first send funds to the address where the contract will reside.

:::info

A new address is always calculated based on the bytecode of the contract constructor to deploy a contract. As a result, only the contract with a specific constructor can occupy its allocated address. This makes it so that funds sent to an address can only be used by the contract intended for this address.

:::

### Via the =nil; CLI

First, calulate the address of the retailer contract and send funds to this address:

```bash file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-cli.test.mjs start=startExternalRetailerAddressCommand end=endExternalRetailerAddressCommand
```

```bash file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-cli.test.mjs start=startSendTokensToRetailerForExternalDeployment end=endSendTokensToRetailerForExternalDeployment
```

Then, deploy the retailer contract while providing the same `SALT`:

```bash file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-cli.test.mjs start=startRetailerExternalDeploymentCommand end=endRetailerExternalDeploymentCommand
```

Retrieve the public key assigned to the smart account:

```bash file=../../../tests/commands.mjs start=startInfo end=endInfo
```

Calculate the address of the manufacturer contract and send funds to it:

```bash file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-cli.test.mjs start=startExternalManufacturerAddressCommand end=endExternalManufacturerAddressCommand
```

```bash file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-cli.test.mjs start=startSendTokensToManufacturerForExternalDeploymentCommand end=endSendTokensToManufacturerForExternalDeploymentCommand
```

Deploy the manufacturer contract:

```bash file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-cli.test.mjs start=startManufacturerExternalDeploymentCommand end=endManufacturerExternalDeploymentCommand
```

### Via the client library

:::tip

When submitting contract bytecode as a string to a deployment transaction, preface it with "0x".

The contract ABI can be copy-pasted from the `./abi` file and then cast into the `Abi` type.

:::

To deploy the retailer contract:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-niljs.test.mjs start=startExternalDeployOfRetailer end=endExternalDeployOfRetailer
```

To deploy the manufacturer contract:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-niljs.test.mjs start=startExternalDeployOfManufacturer end=endExternalDeployOfManufacturer
```

## Opcode deployment

It is also possible to deploy contracts without having to send an external or an internal transaction: this is done by directly using the `CREATE` and `CREATE2` opcodes.

To use `CREATE` in Solidity:

```solidity showLineNumbers
import "./Nil.sol";

using Nil for address;

contract Manufacturer {
    ...
}

contract Creator {

    function deployContract() private returns (address deployedAddress) {
        bytes memory code = abi.encodePacked(type(NewContract).creationCode, abi.encode(msg.sender));

        assembly {
            deployedAddress := create(callvalue(), add(code), mload(code))
        }

        return deployedAddress;
    }
}
```

To use CREATE2 in Solidity:

```solidity showLineNumbers
import "./Nil.sol";

using Nil for address;

contract Manufacturer {
    ...
}

contract Creator {
    function deployContract(uint salt) private returns (address deployedAddress) {
        bytes memory code = type(NewContract).creationCode;

        assembly {
            deployedAddress := create2(callvalue(), add(code, 0x20), mload(code), salt);
        }

        return deployedAddress;
    }
}
```
