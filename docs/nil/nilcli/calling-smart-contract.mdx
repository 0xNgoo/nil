# =nil; CLI: calling smart contracts 

This tutorial shows how to call [**the previously deployed manufacturer and retailer contracts**](./deploying-smart-contract.mdx).

## Via internal transactions

To call the `orderProduct()` function inside the retailer contract and trigger an async call:

```bash file=../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-cli.test.mjs start=startSendTokensCommand end=endSendTokensCommand
```

```bash file=../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-cli.test.mjs start=startRetailerCallManufacturer end=endRetailerCallManufacturer
```

Make a readonly call to access the value:

```bash file=../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-cli.test.mjs start=startCallToManufacturerCommand end=endCallToManufacturerCommand
```

The CLI should output the decoded values automatically.

## Via external transactions

The CLI currently does not support sending external transactions that modify the internal state of smart contracts or spawn internal transactions. As a result, sending an external transaction to a function that performs an async call to another function will fail. 

In the retailer contract, the `orderProduct()` function cannot be called externally as it makes an async call to the manufacturer.
