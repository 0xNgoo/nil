# =nil; CLI: working with tokens

To create a new token and withdraw it to the address of the owner:

```bash file=../../tests/multi-tokens-support.test.mjs start=startBasicCreateTokenCommand end=endBasicCreateTokenCommand
```

```bash file=../../tests/multi-tokens-support.test.mjs start=startBasicWithdrawTokenCommand end=endBasicWithdrawTokenCommand
```

To mint an existing token (which automatically withdraws it to the owner):

```bash file=../../tests/multi-tokens-support.test.mjs start=startMintExistingTokenCommand end=endMintExistingTokenCommand
```

To burn an existing token (the supply is automatically reduced at the address of the owner):

```bash file=../../tests/multi-tokens-support.test.mjs start=startBurnExistingTokenCommand end=endBurnExistingTokenCommand
```
