# =nil; CLI: reading and writing info

The =nil; CLI provides several commands that produce data about key cluster entities including blocks, transactions, and logs.

To view the latest block recorded by shard with `shardId = 1`:

```bash file=../../tests/commands.mjs start=startLatestBlock end=endLatestBlock
```

To call an existing smart contract via the smart account:

```bash
nil smart-account send-transaction CONTRACT_ADDRESS METHOD_NAME [ARGS] --abi path/to/contract.abi
```

To read information about the resulting transaction:

```bash file=../../tests/reading-and-writing.test.mjs start=startTransactionRead end=endTransactionRead
```

To read the transaction receipt:

```bash file=../../tests/reading-and-writing.test.mjs start=startReceiptRead end=endReceiptRead
```
