# `smart-contracts`: getting started

## Overview

The `smart-contracts` NPM package contains the Solidity extensions for working with =nil;. The package includes four contracts:

* [**Faucet.sol**](https://github.com/NilFoundation/nil/blob/main/smart-contracts/contracts/Faucet.sol) is a service contract for distributing tokens
* [**Nil.sol**](https://github.com/NilFoundation/nil/blob/main/smart-contracts/contracts/Nil.sol) is the extension library that allows for making async calls and performing other essential operations
* [**NilTokenBase.sol**](https://github.com/NilFoundation/nil/blob/main/smart-contracts/contracts/NilTokenBase.sol) is the base contract for custom tokens on the cluster
* [**SmartAccount.sol**](https://github.com/NilFoundation/nil/blob/main/smart-contracts/contracts/SmartAccount.sol) is the default smart account that is deployed by the =nil; CLI and Nil.js

## Installation and usage

To install the package:

<Tabs groupId='packageSystem'>
  <TabItem value='npm' label='npm'>
    ```bash
    npm install @nilfoundation/smart-contracts
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='yarn' label='yarn'>
    ```bash
    yarn add @nilfoundation/smart-contracts
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To use the package, simply import the required contract in a project. 

In a JS/TS project:

```ts showLineNumbers
import SmartAccount_compiled from '@nilfoundation/smart-contracts/artifacts/SmartAccount.json';
const smartAccount_bytecode = `0x${SmartAccount_compiled.evm.bytecode.object}`
```

In a Solidity smart contract:

```solidity showLineNumbers
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@nilfoundation/smart-contracts/contracts/SmartAccount.sol";
```
